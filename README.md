# iGEM Wiki Skills

A modular Codex skill collection for researching, planning, writing, implementing, and auditing evidence-led iGEM team wikis.

Current release: **v0.8.0**

## Skills

| Skill | Scope |
|---|---|
| `igem-wiki` | Whole-wiki architecture, current-season compliance, cross-page claims, AI integrity, and task routing |
| `igem-wiki-story` | Home, Description, Awards, navigation, and project narrative |
| `igem-wetlab-wiki` | Design, Experiments, Engineering, Results, Measurement, Parts, Protocols, and Notebook |
| `igem-model-wiki` | Modeling, equations, computational evidence, validation, and reproducibility |
| `igem-hp-wiki` | Human Practices, Education, Inclusivity, Sustainability, ethics, and stakeholder integration |
| `igem-implementation-wiki` | Implementation, Safety, Entrepreneurship, Hardware, Software, and Contribution |

## What v0.8.0 adds

Release v0.8.0 adds a module-level Model evidence corpus, while retaining the v0.7.1 rendered-page refresh, pinned CI actions, and expanded static auditor.

- a machine-readable benchmark corpus with **1,054 official award records** and **101 domain-scoped page-review records**;
- controlled taxonomy for all 14 reviewed Model pages across archetype, validation type, data source, and project decision;
- **34 inspected Model modules across every year from 2021 through 2025**, recording biological question, method, parameter provenance, evidence scope, reproduction path, project decision, and a concrete limitation;
- evidence-fit Model precedent queries, so scientific relevance comes before recency or award prestige;
- at least two reviewed examples for every maintained core page function, including Awards, Experiments, Parts, Notebook, Sustainability, Implementation, and Entrepreneurship;
- expanded static-site checks for local assets, heading hierarchy, machine-local paths, figure captions, and caller-supplied required routes;
- complete mapped 2021–2025 award-family imports with explicit historical-title contracts, including 42 recovered 2021 records;
- exact official API JSON snapshots verified against the source manifest hashes;
- structured primary award links for page reviews and visible year, class, status, and page-function coverage;
- compact reviewed-page indexes separated from full official award ledgers for progressive loading;
- dependency-free corpus query and read-only static-site audit tools;
- four whole-wiki intake, production, judging-readiness, and browser-QA templates;
- deterministic regression tests plus release-version and evaluation-contract validation;
- a documented semantic-version release process that separates descriptive development commits from versioned releases.

The earlier evidence templates, 2026 judging snapshot, AI-integrity protocol, Claim-Evidence Register, and cross-year sampling rules remain included.

## Research basis

The reference corpus distinguishes:

- official winner and nominee records from the [iGEM Annual Results](https://competition.igem.org/results/);
- observations from individual team wiki pages;
- reusable principles, meaningful exceptions, limitations, and accessibility risks.

Award-winning pages are precedents to analyze, not templates to copy. Historical patterns are not judging rules. Current criteria, eligibility, policies, Standard URLs, and deadlines must be refreshed from official iGEM sources when they affect a decision.

Machine-readable sources live in `corpus/award_records.csv`, `corpus/page_reviews.csv`, `corpus/model_review_metadata.csv`, `corpus/model_modules.csv`, and `corpus/source_manifest.csv`; exact official inputs live in `corpus/snapshots/`. The maintained sample follows `igem-wiki/references/sampling-policy.md`. Use `scripts/import_annual_results.py` for reproducible annual imports, then run `python3 scripts/build_corpus.py`. Use `scripts/query_corpus.py` to select only relevant records. The generated compact reviewed-page indexes, Model page taxonomy, Model module evidence index, and separate full award ledgers are committed so a skill can use them without running code.

For example, select Model precedents by scientific role rather than year alone:

```bash
python3 scripts/query_corpus.py model-modules \
  --model-archetype stochastic --project-decision stopping-policy \
  --evidence-scope validated-with-team-data
```

## Installation

### Project-local

Copy all six directories into the project's `.agents/skills/` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/skills
cp -R /path/to/igem-wiki-skills/igem-* .agents/skills/
```

Install the full collection when using `igem-wiki`, because the coordinator routes specialized work to its five sibling skills. A single domain skill can be installed alone when only that domain is needed.

### Personal

```bash
mkdir -p "$CODEX_HOME/skills"
cp -R /path/to/igem-wiki-skills/igem-* "$CODEX_HOME/skills/"
```

Restart or reload Codex if the new skills are not discovered immediately.

## Usage examples

```text
Use $igem-wiki to build a Claim-Evidence Register and audit our full wiki against current judging requirements.

Use $igem-model-wiki to review whether a single-sequence demonstration has been generalized beyond its evidence.

Use $igem-hp-wiki to turn our engagement records into an evidence-backed integration log.

Use $igem-wetlab-wiki to review whether our Results figures support their claims and document a complete DBTL cycle.
```

## Templates

- `igem-wiki/assets/templates/whole-wiki-evidence-map.md`
- `igem-wiki/assets/templates/page-brief.md`
- `igem-wiki/assets/templates/figure-evidence-card.md`
- `igem-wiki/assets/templates/team-intake.md`
- `igem-wiki/assets/templates/judging-readiness-matrix.md`
- `igem-wiki/assets/templates/wiki-production-board.md`
- `igem-wiki/assets/templates/browser-qa-report.md`
- `igem-wetlab-wiki/assets/templates/dbtl-cycle.md`
- `igem-model-wiki/assets/templates/model-card.md`
- `igem-hp-wiki/assets/templates/integration-log.md`
- `igem-implementation-wiki/assets/templates/readiness-matrix.md`

## Validation

Run the dependency-free repository validator:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_corpus.py --check
python3 scripts/validate_version.py
python3 scripts/validate_evals.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
python3 scripts/validate_repository.py
```

For a read-only first pass over static HTML:

```bash
python3 igem-wiki/scripts/audit_static_wiki.py /path/to/wiki --no-fail
```

Pass current-season Standard URLs explicitly when needed, for example:

```bash
python3 igem-wiki/scripts/audit_static_wiki.py /path/to/wiki --no-fail \
  --required-route model --required-route human-practices
```

For a shareable report or an explicitly requested network-assisted pass:

```bash
python3 igem-wiki/scripts/audit_static_wiki.py /path/to/wiki \
  --exclude drafts --markdown
python3 igem-wiki/scripts/audit_static_wiki.py /path/to/wiki \
  --check-external --external-timeout 8 --no-fail
```

External checking is optional and allowlisted; keep it out of deterministic CI and interpret connection failures as review prompts.

The checks validate corpus schema and raw-source hashes, duplicate records, official award relationships, domain-year sampling floors, winner/nominee and competition-class coverage, generated-index freshness, release metadata, evaluation contracts, deterministic tool behavior, skill entrypoints, UI metadata, installed-layout references, required resources, and unfinished placeholders. GitHub Actions runs these checks on pushes and pull requests. Behavioral scenarios live in `evals/scenarios.md`; CI checks their structure but does not claim to run a model. See [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) for the version and release policy.
